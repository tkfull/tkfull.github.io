  Welcome! I'm Thomas Fullagar (pronounced “Full-uh-gar”), a recent PhD graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), currently on the job market. My research is broadly in applied labor economics.

  My job market paper examines the causal effects of union elections on firm stock prices. The second chapter of my dissertation analyzes whether a comprehensive wage transparency law reduced gender earnings gaps. The final chapter explores how the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) affected pharmaceutical firms’ R&D investment decisions.
  
  While at UCSB, I also worked at the <a href="https://efp.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Economic Forecast Project</a> (EFP). Where I helped create interactive dashboards informing the public on socioeconomic trends within the county. Prior to UCSB, I worked at Welch Consulting, a leader in economic consulting, research, and analysis of labor and employment issues.

  Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer, reading, and walking on the beach with <a href="mocha.jpg">Mocha</a>.
